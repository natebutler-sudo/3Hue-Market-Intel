# Original acceptance register

All 43 source bullets are retained verbatim below, including every clause and viewport. The full instruction register is in [requirements.json](requirements.json). Apply only the [three approved overrides](overrides.md); the original text stays unchanged.

A failed image requirement is recorded as Fail even though stopping complies with the document. Nothing about the candidate is accepted by inference. Unrun checks remain Not run.

## Phase 1 — 1-clean-plate.md

Target: Clean image, approval gate and responsive assets.

### P1-D01 — Fail

Source: [1-clean-plate.md, line 23](source/1-clean-plate.md#L23).

- At 2× zoom the plate shows no legible letter or number and no UI shape (pill, arrow circle, header band).

Measured result: Candidate 02 passes removal of painted words, but retains a broad blank navy header-shaped band with a sharp lower boundary around y=63–66 at the 1672px reference width (native y≈109–114). The ceiling/glazing does not continue through it. Guardian rejected this residual UI geometry.

Candidate guardian: Fail. Published guardian: Not run.

Evidence: [reviews/phase-1-candidate-02.md](reviews/phase-1-candidate-02.md)

### P1-D02 — Not run

Source: [1-clean-plate.md, line 24](source/1-clean-plate.md#L24).

- Laid over the original at 50% opacity, scaled to 1672 wide, the doorways, stair, tower rings, table, bust and kiosk line up within 6 px, including the doorway centres 333,537, 748,535 and 1357,540.

Measured result: Full acceptance is not run because complete clean-plate clearance is outstanding. Guardian sampled 35 landmarks: 33 matched at 0–1px; two were inconclusive around the repaired stair and dark foreground chair.

Candidate guardian: Not run — blocked by P1-D01. Published guardian: Not run.

### P1-D03 — Pass

Source: [1-clean-plate.md, line 25](source/1-clean-plate.md#L25).

- The sign panels, kiosk screen and ring bands are still lit, just empty.

Measured result: Guardian visual inspection confirms the three sign panels, kiosk screen and four tower ring bands/base line remain illuminated and empty.

Candidate guardian: Pass. Published guardian: Not run.

Evidence: [reviews/phase-1-candidate-02.md](reviews/phase-1-candidate-02.md)

### P1-D04 — Pass

Source: [1-clean-plate.md, line 26](source/1-clean-plate.md#L26).

- You reported the plate's exact size, and it is at least 1920×1080 at 16:9 (±1 px), or you stopped.

Measured result: Candidate 02 is 2880×1621, 4,679,649 bytes, with +1px height deviation from 16:9. It meets the at-least-1920×1080 native-size rule. Candidate 01 remains historically rejected at 1672×941; see its separate review.

Candidate guardian: Fail. Published guardian: Not run.

Evidence: [reviews/phase-1-candidate-02.md](reviews/phase-1-candidate-02.md), [reviews/phase-1-candidate-01.md](reviews/phase-1-candidate-01.md)

### P1-D05 — Not run

Source: [1-clean-plate.md, line 27](source/1-clean-plate.md#L27).

- After my OK: every saved file returns 200, each AVIF and WebP copy is 500 KB or less, and the live lobby still shows the old image.

Measured result: User artwork-OK gate is satisfied. Master and responsive variants are prepared; all AVIF/WebP files are below 500 KB and local dimensions are verified. HTTP 200 checks after publication and confirmation that the live lobby still serves the old image remain not run.

Candidate guardian: Not run. Published guardian: Not run.

Evidence: [reviews/phase-1-assets.md](reviews/phase-1-assets.md)

## Phase 2a — 2a-baseline-stage-labels.md
